    "abstract": "Nanotechnologies promise new solutions for several applications in the biomedical, industrial and military fields. At the nanoscale, a nanomachine is considered as the most basic functional unit which is able to perform very simple tasks. Communication among nanomachines will allow them to accomplish more complex functions in a distributed manner. In this paper, the state of the art in molecular electronics is reviewed to motivate the study of the Terahertz Band (0.1-10.0 THz) for electromagnetic (EM) communication among nano-devices. A new propagation model for EM communications in the Terahertz Band is developed based on radiative transfer theory and in light of molecular absorption. This model accounts for the total path loss and the molecular absorption noise that a wave in the Terahertz Band suffers when propagating over very short distances. Finally, the channel capacity of the Terahertz Band is investigated by using this model for different power allocation schemes, including a scheme based on the transmission of femtosecond-long pulses. The results show that for very short transmission distances, in the order of several tens of millimeters, the Terahertz channel supports very large bit-rates, up to few terabits per second, which enables a radically different communication paradigm for nanonetworks.",

    "abstract": "Molecular communication is a promising paradigm for nanoscale networks. The end-to-end (including the channel) models developed for classical wireless communication networks need to undergo a profound revision so that they can be applied for nanonetworks. Consequently, there is a need to develop new end-to-end (including the channel) models which can give new insights into the design of these nanoscale networks. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new physical end-to-end (including the channel) model for molecular communication. The new model is investigated by means of three modules, i.e., the transmitter, the signal propagation and the receiver. Each module is related to a specific process involving particle exchanges, namely, particle emission, particle diffusion and particle reception. The particle emission process involves the increase or decrease of the particle concentration rate in the environment according to a modulating input signal. The particle diffusion provides the propagation of particles from the transmitter to the receiver by means of the physics laws underlying particle diffusion in the space. The particle reception process is identified by the sensing of the particle concentration value at the receiver location. Numerical results are provided for three modules, as well as for the overall end-to-end model, in terms of normalized gain and delay as functions of the input frequency and of the transmission range.",

    "abstract": "Time and frequency domain channel models are proposed for nanonetworks utilizing the terahertz band (0.1-10 THz) for wireless communication. Nanonetworks are formed by tiny nanodevices which consist of nanoscale (molecular scale) components. Channel models capturing the unique peculiarities of the THz band are needed for designing proper physical layer techniques and for accurate performance analysis. Existing channel models have included the free space path loss and the molecular absorption loss, which is significant in the THz band. This paper theoretically analyzes scattering including multiple scattering referring to a sequence of scattering events from small particles, such as aerosols. Both the frequency and the impulse responses are derived. It is shown that the small particle scattering can result into significant additional loss that needs to be taken into account with the loss depending on the density and size distribution of the particles. It is shown that multiple scattering leads to a long tail in the impulse response. As most of the physical layer proposals for nanonetworks are based on the on-off keying, the channel response to pulse waveforms is specifically considered.",

Coordination and information sharing among these nano-devices will lead towards the development of future nanonetworks, rising new applications of nanotechnology in the medical, environmental and military fields. Despite the major progress in nano-device design and fabrication, it is still not clear how these atomically precise machines will communicate. The latest advancements in graphene- based electronics have opened the door to electromagnetic communication among nano-devices in the terahertz band (0.1-10 THz). This frequency band can potentially provide very large bandwidths, ranging from the entire band to several gigahertz- wide windows, depending on the transmission distance and the molecular composition of the channel. In this paper, the capacity of the terahertz channel is numerically evaluated by using a new terahertz propagation model, for different channel molecular compositions, and under different power allocation schemes. A novel communication technique based on the transmission of ultra-short pulses, less than one picosecond long, is motivated and quantitatively compared to the capacity- optimal power allocation scheme. The results show that for the very short range, up to a few tens of millimeters, the transmission of short pulses offer a realistic and still efficient way to exploit the terahertz channel.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based molecular communication over nanonetworks is an emerging communication paradigm that enables nanomachines to communicate by using molecules as the information carrier. For such a communication paradigm, Concentration Shift Keying (CSK) has been considered as one of the most promising techniques for modulating information symbols, owing to its inherent simplicity and practicality. CSK modulated subsequent information symbols, however, may interfere with each other due to the random amount of time that molecules of each modulated symbols take to reach the receiver nanomachine. To alleviate Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) problem associated with CSK, we propose a new modulation technique called Zebra-CSK. The proposed Zebra-CSK adds inhibitor molecules in CSK-modulated molecular signal to selectively suppress ISI causing molecules. Numerical results from our newly developed probabilistic analytical model show that Zebra-CSK not only enhances capacity of the molecular channel but also reduces symbol error probability observed at the receiver nanomachine.",

However, it is still not clear how these nanosystems will communicate among them. This work considers a scenario of Diffusion-based Molecular Communication (DMC), a promising paradigm that has been recently proposed to implement nanonetworks. In a DMC network, transmitters encode information by the emission of molecules which diffuse throughout the medium, eventually reaching the receiver locations. In this scenario, a pulse-based modulation scheme is proposed and two techniques for the detection of the molecular pulses, namely, amplitude detection and energy detection, are compared. In order to evaluate the performance of DMC using both detection schemes, the most important communication metrics in each case are identified. Their analytical expressions are obtained and validated by simulation. Finally, the scalability of the obtained performance evaluation metrics in both detection techniques is compared in order to determine their suitability to particular DMC scenarios. Energy detection is found to be more suitable when the transmission distance constitutes a bottleneck in the performance of the network, whereas amplitude detection will allow achieving a higher transmission rate in the cases where the transmission distance is not a limitation. These results provide interesting insights which may serve designers as a guide to implement future DMC networks.",

Since in our scheme the decoding of the current symbol does not depend on the previously transmitted and decoded symbols, we do not encounter error propagation; and so as our numerical results indicate, the proposed scheme outperforms the previously introduced schemes.

The motivation behind these nanonetworks is to enhance the complexity and range of operation of the system, as the nanomachines that will be part of these networks have significant limitations in terms of size and power consumption. Neither classical communication schemes nor protocols used in conventional networks are valid in this new scenario.

In this paper, we propose Quorum Sensing as a valid tool to achieve synchronization in a cluster of nodes of a nanonetwork by means of molecular communication, and in a distributed manner. Quorum Sensing is a mechanism by which bacteria coordinate their behavior, based on the emission and reception of molecules called autoinducers.

In order to ensure an effective real-time cooperation, it is necessary to keep the clock synchronized among the nanomachines in the nanonetwork. This paper proposes a model on a two-way message exchange mechanism with the molecular propagation delay based on the inverse Gaussian distribution. The clock offset and clock skew are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Simulation results by MATLAB show that the mean square errors (MSE) of the estimated clock offsets and clock skews can be reduced and converge with a number of rounds of message exchanges. The comparison of the proposed scheme with a clock synchronization method based on symmetrical propagation delay demonstrates that our proposed scheme can achieve a better performance in terms of accuracy.",

Specifically, we propose a local estimation model to approximate the readings of sensor nodes in subsets, and prove rated error-bounds of data collection using this model. In the process of model-based data collection, we formulate the problem of selecting the minimum subset of sensor nodes into a minimum dominating set problem which is known to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy heuristic algorithm to find an approximate solution. We further propose a monitoring algorithm to adaptively adjust the composition of node subsets according to changes of sensor readings. Our trace-driven simulations demonstrate that ADC remarkably reduces communication cost of data collection with guaranteed error bounds.",

    "query": "WSN + Energy Budget (10)",
    "publication_year": 2014,
    "abstract": "Abstract We examined 3 years of measured daily values of all major water budget components (precipitation P , potential evapotranspiration PET , actual evapotranspiration ET , and runoff R ) and volumetric soil water content θ of a small, forested catchment located in the west of Germany. The spatial distribution of θ was determined from a wireless sensor network of 109 points with 3 measurement depths each; ET was calculated from eddy‐covariance tower measurements. The water budget was dominantly energy limited, with ET amounting to approximately 90% of PET , and a runoff ratio R/P of 56%. P , ET , and R closed the long‐term water budget with a residual of 2% of precipitation. On the daily time scale, the residual of the water budget was larger than on the annual time scale, and explained to a moderate extent by θ ( R 2 = 0.40). Wavelet analysis revealed subweekly time scales, presumably dominated by unaccounted fast‐turnover storage terms such as interception, as a major source of uncertainty in water balance closure. At weekly resolution, soil water content explained more than half ( R 2 = 0.62) of the residual. By means of combined empirical orthogonal function and cluster analysis, two slightly different spatial patterns of θ could be identified that were associated with mean θ values below and above 0.35 cm 3 /cm 3 , respectively. The timing of these patterns as well as the varying coherence between PET , ET , and soil water content responded to changes in water availability, including a moderate response to the European drought in spring 2011.",

    "query": "WSN + Energy Budget (10)",
    "publication_year": 2015,
    "abstract": "In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), due to the restriction of scarce energy, it remains an open challenge how to schedule the data communications between the sensor nodes and the sink to reduce power usage with the aim of maximizing the network lifetime. To face this challenge, this paper proposes a workable data communication scheme utilizing the hierarchical Least-Mean-Square (HLMS) adaptive filter. The HLMS predicting techniques are explored that predict the measured values both at the source and at the sink, sensor nodes are subsequently required only to send those readings that deviate from the prediction by an error budget. Such data reduction strategy achieves significant power savings by reducing the amount of data sent by each node. We discuss the working mechanism of HLMS in the purpose of data reduction in WSNs, analyze the mean-squared error in the two level HLMS, and design the interactive HLMS prediction algorithm implemented at sink and sensor node and the transmission protocol between them. To elaborate on our theoretical proposal, the HLMS algorithms and protocols are then evaluated by simulation. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme achieves major improvement in convergence speed compared with previous approaches, and achieves up to 95% communication reduction for the temperature measurements acquired at Intel Berkeley lab while maintaining a minimal accuracy of 0.3 °C.",

    "abstract": "Wireless charging technology is considered as one of the promising solutions to solve the energy limitation problem for large-scale wireless sensor networks. Obviously, charger deployment is a critical issue since the number of chargers would be limited by the network construction budget, which makes the full-coverage deployment of chargers infeasible. In many of the applications targeted by large-scale wireless sensor networks, end-devices are usually equipped by the human and their movement follows some degree of regularity. Therefore in this paper, we utilize this property to deploy chargers with partial coverage, with an objective to maximize the survival rate of end-devices. We prove this problem is NP-hard, and propose an algorithm to tackle it. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can significantly increase the survival rate of end-devices. To our knowledge, this is one of very first works that consider charger deployment with partial coverage in wireless rechargeable sensor networks.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor nodes have a limited power budget, while they are often expected to be functional for a very long period of time once deployed in the field. Therefore, the minimization of energy consumption and energy harvesting technology are key tools for maximization of network lifetime and achieving self sustainability in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). This paper proposes an energy aware Adaptive Sampling Algorithm (ASA) for WSN with power hungry sensors and harvesting capabilities. An existing ASA developed for wireless sensor networks with power hungry sensors is optimized and enhanced to adapt the sampling frequency according to the available energy of the node. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using an in-field testbed with a sensor node which incorporates a wind harvester and a power hungry wind speed/direction sensor. Simulation and comparison between an existing ASA and the energy aware ASA in terms of energy durability are carried out using the measured wind energy and the wind speed over a period of a month. The simulation results have shown that using ASA in combination with energy aware function on the nodes can drastically increase the lifetime of a WSN node. Moreover, the energy aware ASA in conjunction with the node energy harvesting capability can lead towards a perpetual operation of WSN and significantly outperform state-of-the-art ASA.",

    "query": "WSN + Energy Budget (10)",
    "publication_year": 2015,
    "abstract": "This paper presents a fully-integrated μW-level photovoltaic (PV) self-sustaining energy harvesting system proposed for smart nodes of Internet of Things (IOT) networks. A hysteresis regulation is designed to provide a constant 3.3 V output voltage for a host of applications, including powering sensors, signal processors, and wireless transmitters. Due to the stringent power budget in IOT scenarios, the power consumption of the harvesting system is optimized by multiple system and circuit level techniques. Firstly, the hill-climbing MPPT mechanism reuses and processes the information of the hysteresis controller in the time-domain and is free of power hungry analog circuits. Secondly, the typical power-performance tradeoff of the hysteresis controller is solved by a self-triggered one-shot mechanism. Thus, the output regulation achieves high-performance and yet low-power operations. Thirdly, to execute the impedance tuning of MPPT, the capacitor value modulation (CVM) scheme is proposed instead of the conventional frequency modulation scheme, avoiding quiescent power consumption. Utilizing a commercial PV cell of 2.5 cm 2 , the proposed system provides 0-21 μW output power to the IOT smart nodes. Measured results showed that the PV harvesting system achieved both ultra-low power operation capability at 12 μW and a peak self-sustaining efficiency of 86%.",
